# Dog-Identification-App

# Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. In this project there is an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

# Project Overview:
The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed. In this project we have developed an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 

# Steps to develop the project:
1)Import datasets
2)Detect humans
3)Detect Dogs
4) Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
5) Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
6) Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
7) Write your Algorithm
8) Test Your Algorithm

# Conclusion:
In this project we have applied the deep learning and neural network to predict that a particular image is a breed of the dog .If it is not then it shows the message likewise” Hum... seems this neither dog, nor human; must be something else”. , I have made important design decisions about the user experience for our app. By completing this lab, I understood the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.
